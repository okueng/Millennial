Hi there!
I'm Olivier! I'm fascinated by tech, agility and anything related to products. I have started (but not finished) a Phd in Computer Vision at EPFL and co-founded [Pix4D]("https://pix4d.com"), a drone photogrametry company, in 2011. I am now exploring the world and hacking stuff to make sense of all of that.
