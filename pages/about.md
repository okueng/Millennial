## Hi there!

I'm Olivier and I'm fascinated by tech, agility and anything related to creating products. I have started (but not finished) a Phd at the computer vision [lab](http://cvlab.epfl.ch) at EPFL and co-founded [Pix4D](https://pix4d.com), a drone photogrametry company, in 2011. After 7 years of growing it into an amazing international company that changed the way people measure and capture their environment, I am now exploring the world and hacking stuff to make sense of all of that.
